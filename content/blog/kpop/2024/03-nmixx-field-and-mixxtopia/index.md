## Before we start the story

The controversy around the meaning of art (including contemporary popular forms of art) is the very foundation in aesthetics and philosophy of art. In this post, I will assume the readers would think my view of it as a valid one.

In my opinion, any form of art is not entirely about the artist or the creator; the meaning or meaningfulness of art emerges from the relationship and interaction between the creative work and the person who appreciate it, no matter how informed or knowledgeable the person is. It is something like many scientists and philosophers believe that our conscious experience emerges from the traits and juxtapositions of the physical aspects of the biochemical machine we have, but at the same time the consciousness cannot be reduced back to the mere physical materials. To continue this analogy, creative artistic work is just a complexly composed set of information and the meaning of it is something more than that albeit it's fully based on the set of information.

In other words, my interpretation of the storytelling behind NMIXX might not be something the creators or the singers themselves intended; but as the author Mark Manson says in his book _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_, most of the time, we all do our everyday activites without thinking or knowing what the f*ck they mean. And that does not make our life meaningless.

So, this post is about how the meaning emerges for me with its relationship with me, from the storytelling behind NMIXX -- and I hope you (if anyone reads it) enjoy getting to know my view.

## Why is it about the whole humanity and beyond?

In the first story film titled _New Frontier: Declaration_, the English narration (probably from Lily) tells you about the ambition and reasoning behind the journey of NMIXX that was about to start. She tells us about the utopia she saw (later confirmed as MIXXTOPIA), and the reality in her perspective. She says:

> Here, happiness exists with pain, and hope exists with disappointments.  
> There are the ones who are neglected, (and) there are the ones who must face the blizzard with their entire being.  
> ...  
> Probably, everything will be new, eternal and chained together in that world.  
> And we are absolutely ready to love that world.  
> Why should we go there? Not because that is easy, but because that is hard.

She tells us about in the "real" world we experience and live in, there are always the counterparts of concepts and the irony from those. And she also tells us that the MIXXTOPIA has everything "new, eternal and chained together". Moreover, she ensures that the journey itself would be hard, but ironically, the reason we must go on the journey is in the very fact that it's hard.

The name of utopia in this whole storytelling, MIXXTOPIA, tells us a thing as well. In the second law of thermodynamics, everything in the universe moves towards the direction of more random, more mixed up world of matters, and the ever-increasing randomness is called entropy. And the ultimate goal of the universe, albeit not being an intentional goal, is the perfectly mixed-up state (heat death or maximum entropy).

As a well-known etymology, utopia is from greek words u (non-) and topos (exist). It is a perfect world that never exists in the reality. Maybe it's except for the final state of the universe. The final goal of the universe is, as we saw above, the perfectly mixed up, perfectly diverse yet ironically monotone, state. In that sense, the name MIXXTOPIA makes perfect sense. In the ever-repeating ultimate Monte Carlo simulation machine of the universe, the meaning of the whole process emerges from the process of itself, and that is the information, which might be the everything we experience (rather than the matter itself).

Furthermore, in that context, "everything is chained together". The meaning of everything exists in the relationship and correlation of two or more things, as we see in information universe hypothesis. And in a smaller scale, the humanity, or the lives of each individual humans, are like that as well. We exist in the relationship and correlation to each other, and that is what makes the life meaningful ([see my review of the song _Run for Roses_ from NMIXX](blog/kpop/2024/02-nmixx-run-for-roses/)).

The lyrics of their debut song _O.O_ tells us about this too; it says:

> 영과 일의 미로가 보여? (Do you see the maze of 0 and 1?)  
> 보고 있지만 말고 follow (follow, don't just stop and look)  
> 'Cause everything is fake, but I ain't a fake  
> 진짜 시작은 지금부터 (the real beginning is now)  

The binary numbers, in my perspective, represents the units of information. As in [simulation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis), The whole universe might be a digital simulation, whether if it's intentionally ran by someone or not. But that does not mean we are meaningless or not real ("'Cause everything is fake, but I ain't a fake").

## Continuing the struggle of life against perpetrators

Just like their debut album name following the debut album series _New Frontier_ is _AD MARE_ (To the Sea), the second album is called _Entwurf_ ('Draft' as in a blueprint in German).
