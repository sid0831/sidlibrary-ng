## Before we start the story

The controversy around the meaning of art (including contemporary popular forms of art) is the very foundation in aesthetics and philosophy of art. In this post, I will assume the readers would think my view of it as a valid one.

In my opinion, any form of art is not entirely about the artist or the creator; the meaning or meaningfulness of art emerges from the relationship and interaction between the creative work and the person who appreciate it, no matter how informed or knowledgeable the person is. It is something like many scientists and philosophers believe that our conscious experience emerges from the traits and juxtapositions of the physical aspects of the biochemical machine we have, but at the same time the consciousness cannot be reduced back to the mere physical materials. To continue this analogy, creative artistic work is just a complexly composed set of information and the meaning of it is something more than that albeit it's fully based on the set of information.

In other words, my interpretation of the storytelling behind NMIXX might not be something the creators or the singers themselves intended; but as the author Mark Manson says in his book _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_, most of the time, we all do our everyday activites without thinking or knowing what the f*ck they mean. And that does not make our life meaningless.

So, this post is about how the meaning emerges for me with its relationship with me, from the storytelling behind NMIXX -- and I hope you (if anyone reads it) enjoy getting to know my view.

## Why is it about the whole humanity?

In the first story film titled _New Frontier: Declaration_, the English narration (probably from Lily) tells you about the ambition and reasoning behind the journey of NMIXX that was about to start.
