Dreamcatcher's new song _Justice_ was released about 2 weeks ago. In K-Pop, they usually do 2~3 weeks of new song promotion in TV music shows, and the stages are the core of the unique visual and musical styles of it. But since there were a lot of schedules for Dreamcatcher, and moreover the main vocalist Siyeon was not available to participate in the promotions for her health issues, the promotion was a little bit short for this song.

The song is the second story of their new parallel universe theme. As some readers might already know, Dreamcatcher always changes theme every two or three albums they release ever since their album _Dystopia: The Tree of Language (2020)_. They usually put a special album between the themes for a padding as well. And the each themes always tell a story.

This time, the theme is called the parallel universe. While their first song in the series, _OOTD_, was talking about a narcissist's monologue as the name of the album, _Versus: Villains_, the song _Justice_ tells us a story from the hero's perspective.

The refrain of the song (and the amazing high notes of the singers) ends with the lyrics "Justice makes me fight, justice makes me alive." And this is something not only big heroes feel; in fact, I think a lot of neurodivergent people will agree with the statement since we have high standards of ethics/justice and we apply the standard on both ourselves and others, no matter it is agreeable to many other people or not (and this is why a lot of neurodivergent people with privileged positions in intersectional privilege structure behaves so disgustingly).

In fact, the studies of the relationship between neurodivergent traits such as autism and the ethics concerns suggest that the participation of neurodivergent people in an organisation has a positive effect on the organisation since the neurodivergent people raises the concerns honestly, as they perceive[^1]^,^[^2]^,^[^3]. I think this is the way "justice makes the neurodivergent people alive." And clearly this is a trait that needs a high recognition.

But I am not saying this is the neurodiversity anthem. However, I do hope a lot of neurodivergent K-Pop fans including me can get a courage to be themselves and unmask from this song. It is also related to the catchphrase of my blog: "We must think! But what we must?". We need to be ourselves for the society to stop give us pain for just being ourselves.
