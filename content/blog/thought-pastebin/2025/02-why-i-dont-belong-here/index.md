There are a lot of internal and external critiques of every single culture the humanity has. And a lot of them offer valid points to think, while some of them are based on pure hate or misunderstanding. Some people say "being a critic is easy, changing what they don't like is hard." But for me, it sounds like they're saying natural science is less valuable than engineering, while undermining the power difference and the reachability of one's voice. Yes, someone in a big despair might grunt in raw, enraged voice. But no, that doesn't mean their voice is invalid. Rather, it means that the voice is silenced by colonial oppression and the person didn't even have a chance to obtain or invent words to express what they feel.
