Autonomy is the most sacred value humanity can pursue. It is what makes a human truly human, and a conscious experience distinct from a mere complex natural phenomenon -- because if you don't have autonomy, we can't confidently say that you have an independent self distinguished from others in the nature. Just as the serfdom or slavery wasn't exactly a humane condition for those affected by them, the lack of autonomy isn't one too.

One might argue that the universe is deterministic anyway, or the universe is a programmed simulation, so there won't be a true autonomy for any consciousness. While we can keep the philosophical debate for better knowledge about the world, we can say this does not explain the sense of self, whether it's just a delusion or reality, is actually there undeniably for yourself, even if we believe we can't know whether others have it, or if our consciousness is real beyond the empirical level.

Furthermore, that limitation is the very reason I say the autonomy is a value humanity must *pursue*. A pursuit can be done no matter the "final state" we try to achieve is actually achievable or not; Rather, we can say it is humanity's, or every conscious experiences', definitive condition for being.
