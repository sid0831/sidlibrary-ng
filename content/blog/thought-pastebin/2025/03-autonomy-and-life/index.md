Autonomy is the most sacred value humanity can pursue. It is what makes a human truly human, and a conscious experience distinct from a mere complex natural phenomenon -- because if you don't have autonomy, we can't confidently say that you have an independent self distinguished from others in the nature. Just as the serfdom or slavery wasn't exactly a humane condition for those affected by them, the lack, or the unjustified restriction, of autonomy isn't one too.

One might argue that the universe is deterministic anyway, or the universe is a programmed simulation, so there won't be a true autonomy for any consciousness. While we can keep the philosophical debate for better knowledge about the world, we can say this does not explain the sense of self, whether it's just a delusion or reality, is actually there undeniably for yourself, even if we believe we can't know whether others have it, or if our consciousness is real beyond the empirical level.

Furthermore, that limitation is the very reason I say the autonomy is a value humanity must *pursue*. A pursuit can be done no matter the "final state" we try to achieve is actually achievable or not; It is also humanity's, or every conscious experiences', definitive condition for being.

This post is a bit autoethnographic collage of thoughts, developed from this principle. My friend [Jae Young Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Npdte8AAAAJ), a PhD candidate at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, helped me enriching this thought and gave me an idea of writing this post.

### Human Conscious Experience as Prediction Machines

Modern brain science says our brains, especially the conscious experience emerging from it, are prediction machines. It also makes sense in evolutionary perspective: Having a somewhat-inefficient nervous chunk must have been useful for survival by allowing predictions of the future, making us prepared for events that might happen.

From my life experiences, there seems to be two distinct strategies for those prediction: A neurodivergent (ND) way and a neurotypical (NT) way. Neurodivergent way, which is mine, specialises on improving the sensitivity of the prediction; Hence, it can detect a lot of subtle signals from the data like hidden contradictions in large-scale systems, with a compromise of relatively high false positives according to the quality and quantity of available data. Meanwhile, neurotypical way focuses on improving the specificity of the prediction, making it more stable in most situations, albeit it might lead to a higher false negatives, like not noticing a big problem behind.

It is a bit like sorting algorithm differences in organising the available outcomes in the order of plausibility. The ND way is like a merge sort; it is more thorough and it guarantees shorter calculation time in niche situations, but it can be a bit too heavy for everyday situations. On the contrary, the NT way is like a bubble sort. That means the NT way is more lightweight and suitable for faster everyday situation resolution. However, it can lead to a big liability or a panic in rarer, complex situations.

In other words, ND brains tend to run the full Monte Carlo simulation all the time, while NT brains usually focus on speeding up the Markov chain heuristically. It is also consistent with real-world observations where NT people find efficient and quick social conformity by deciding something fast heuristically, while ND people has to check every available data and may panic on low resource situations.

I think this is the reason why I always have been getting told that I shouldn't overthink everything. But in reality, it is just how my brain works -- It also shows why ND people say they can find hidden problems and new insights, but they are on constant overload all the time, while NT people prefer easier judgement and normalcy a lot more.

### What Does This Mean for the Autonomy as the Fundamental Principle?

In operational terms, the autonomy isn't just a freedom from dominance. Although the concept of free will can still be debated, we feel that we actively choose from a multiple-choice list all the time empirically. However, without the human conscious experience's fundamental property of future prediction, it would not actually be a choice; if the brain cannot predict the outcomes, it boils down to merely a reaction from external stimuli.

It is the case for some lesser-complex living organisms in the nature, and the distinguishment of the existence and lack of this property is still unclear. However, at least we humans think we're not a simple mathematical function defined by external stimuli only. Since we're discussing on pragmatic ethical implications of different thought types, that would be enough.

The difference of prediction model the ND and NT brain has matters on achieving this autonomy as information processing. If there can be multiple algorithm of the process, you cannot just say "just let them decide whatever they want" and declare that is autonomy. Instead, the different models should guarantee to respect each other, meaning there would not be an unjustified interference or dominance over a type from another.
