I don't really know where to start about this thought snippet. But one thing is certain: Postmodernism is like a tasty blowfish dish. They are tasty and nutritious, but they're also straight toxins if you don't cook them well.

Personally, I think postmodernism and related 'post-' thoughts are **the** most modern thing the humanity has invented. As in a sense that the modernity is a long-running project that has lasted for a few centuries so far. But they are so only when you understand it in a correct context and background. Which is not the case for most of the people, because almost everyone understands postmodernism as an antithesis for the modernity, or in some cases they lowkey think the postmodernism as a sophisticated reinstatement of pre-modern values that enables them sugarcoat their violence.

Maybe that is the human nature; Maybe we always want to oversimplify things and we always want to act selfish (to be honest, I think that is neurotypical nature compared to neurodivergent nature, rather than human nature). But the project of modernity, including its recent manifestation of postmodernism, is the frantic persuit of humanity to get away from it, in my opinion. Without this context, everything the humanity has accumulated for future generations falls apart and becomes meaningless.

Sometimes, I see the human history, at least for the modern _longue dur√©e_ in a Braudelian sense, as a CI/CD process; we can't get a downtime for our lives. However, we have continuously come up with ideas to patch the bugs and have continuously deployed it on ourselves. And if the CI/CD process becomes long enough, sometimes one or multiple of core functions become a legacy that interferes with next step of development. Capitalism is one thing for us. This core module of modern and contemporary humanity is now a bunch of big legacy codes that is preventing us from taking a next step for the futrue. It is a shipwreck of a ship in which we sailed through the _terra incognita_. That is why the postmodern thoughts are obsessed with deconstruction of things, in my opinion. It is never, ever to reinstate the pre-modern values.

But because we always want to oversimplify and overgeneralise things, this would be an unpopular opinion. But who cares? But who cares? &#129760;
